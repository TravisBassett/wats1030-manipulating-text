I think my favorite command line text editor is probably VI. This is maybe in large part because of the great Lynda tutorial for it. It seems more powerful in a lot of ways thatn Nano, and while Emacs does some nice thing (automatic word wrap in by Git Bash terminal for instance) the mode based interface of VI is enjoyable to me. That being said, the way you navigate through files in Emacs seems more efficient. I can see myself using Nano for most of the types of things I'll be using this class of editor for, but once I'm more comfortable with this type of software I'll probably want to learn VI or Emacs in more detail, maybe going through the Lynda tutorial again once I'm more comfortable with the command line. One big plus is that you can directly run Linux terminal commands through VI. You might be able to do that in EMacs and Nano, I'm not sure it wasn't covered in the required reading. That being said, it's nice that you can use backspace without any nonsense in Emacs, in VI it a whole thing.
