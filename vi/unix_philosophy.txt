x Philosophy
From The Unix Programming Environment (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no
single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the appro$
programming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can't be writt$
down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes mor$
the relationships among programs that from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs
do quite trivial things in isolation, but, when combined with other programs, become gen$
useful tools.
